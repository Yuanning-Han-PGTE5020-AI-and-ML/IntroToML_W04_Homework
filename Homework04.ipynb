    "Steganography is the practice of hiding information within another piece of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "One technique for doing this with images uses something called *bitmasking* and *bit shifting* on individual pixel values. What this means is that we can use each pixel value of the image to hold information about $2$ images, but in a way that isn't as obvious as some of the previous methods we looked at so far.\n",

    "Let's pretend we have the numbers $1242$ and $2664$ and we want to store both of them, but only using $4$ digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we can do that is by first rounding the numbers to the nearest $100$, creating numbers that only use two digits ($1200$ and $2700$), and then combining these into a single 4-digit number, $1227$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can undo this transformation to get back the numbers $1200$ and $2700$, which aren't exactly $1242$ and $2664$, but are close enough.\n",

    "We can see that there are some image sizes that are more common, but it doesn't look like pixel count will tell us anything about the content of the image.\n",

    "Let's repeat the process of extracting info from our files, but this time let's look at the image's color information.\n",

    "We saw many ways of counting pixel colors in the [WK04 notebook](https://github.com/PSAM-5020-2026S-A/WK04): channel histograms, channel separation, channel average value, filtering etc. We could try out a few of these different techniques, but filtering and counting might be the easiest method for extracting info about colors that are in multiple channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we extracted the yellow flowers from the hedgehog image, let's start by filtering and counting the purple pixels. If an image has purple pixels, it's probably a `florist` picture. There's even an [html color](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) called [Orchid](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/color_tryit.asp?color=MediumOrchid) that we can try.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `color_ratio()` function from our [WK04 notebook](https://github.com/PSAM-5020-2026S-A/WK04) is available inside the `Homework04Utils` class, and we can just use it here by calling:\n",

    "```py\n",
    "pixel_ratio = Homework04Utils.color_ratio(pixel_array, color, threshold)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes a pixel array, a color and a threshold value as inputs, and returns the ratio of detected pixels of that color relative to the total number of pixels in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use relative pixel counts or ratios to avoid any kind of bias due to image sizes. If we used absolute count, small areas of purple pixels in large images might overshadow large areas of purple pixels in smaller images."
